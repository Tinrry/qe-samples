!    total energy              =     -22.78072186 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000003 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =       7.97676835 Ry
     hartree contribution      =       1.87026737 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.05493322 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -25.57282435 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in   5 iterations
